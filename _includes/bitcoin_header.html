<p class="text-muted">
    The most successful attempt at creating
    <em>scarcity in the digital realm</em>
    without a trusted third party,
    Bitcoin is a bearer asset that can be transferred
    (over computer networks
    using private/public key cryptography)
    but not duplicated.
    Accessible to anyone,
    it is <em>intrinsic to a public distributed
    uncensorable settlement ledger</em>,
    known as blockchain,
    updated with cryptographic techniques
    and secured by large amounts of energy
    in the form of computational work (mining).
    Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of gold:
    scarce, used as money,
    voluntarily accepted without central planning.
    As much as gold has played a crucial role in
    our civilization and the history of money and finance,
    Bitcoin could be disruptive for the digital civilization
    and the future of money and finance.
    More a crypto-commodity than a crypto-currency,
    Bitcoin aims to be a world reserve asset.
