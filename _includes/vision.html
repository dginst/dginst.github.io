                    <h3>Bitcoin: Digital Gold</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        The most successful attempt at creating
                        <em>scarcity in the digital realm</em>
                        without a trusted third party,
                        Bitcoin is a bearer asset that can be
                        transferred over computer networks but not duplicated.
                        Accessible to anyone, 
                        it is <em>intrinsic to a peculiar uncensorable
                        distributed settlement ledger</em>,
                        updated with cryptographic techniques
                        and secured by large amounts of energy
                        in the form of computational work.
                        Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of gold,
                        disruptive for our current digital civilization
                        and the future of money and finance.
                        More a crypto-commodity then a crypto-currency,
                        Bitcoin aims to be world reserve asset.

                    <h3>Blockchain: Hype or Reality?</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Blockchain is an append-only sequential data structure:
                        to change a block in the middle of the chain all
                        subsequent blocks need to be changed.
                        Very inefficient if compared to a
                        relational database, it is mostly an idiosyncratic
                        technology for digital scarcity.
                        Indeed, <em>blockchain requires an
                        intrinsic native digital asset</em>
                        to provide the economic incentives for the
                        blockchain maintainers to be honest. 
                        Without the seigniorage revenues associated to its
                        native asset, a blockchain system would need to select
                        and appoint its maintainers,
                        ultimately resorting to central governance.

                    <h3>Beyond Bitcoin: Timestamping</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        A timestamp demonstrates that a document existed in a
                        specific status prior to a given point in time.
                        Digital data can be securely timestamped though the
                        <em>attestation</em> of its <em>hash value</em>
                        in a blockchain transaction.
                        <em>OpenTimestamps</em>
                        is a vendor-independent open protocol that defines a
                        set of operations for creating
                        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ots"><em>provable blockchain
                        timestamps</em></a> and later independently verifying them;
                        as such, it allows for third party auditability and
                        is suitable for regulatory prescriptions.
                        What jewelry is for gold, timestamping could be for Bitcoin:
                        not essential but effective at leveraging its beauty.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        The most promising field,
                        instead of
                        technological applications of blockchain,
                        is the development of
                        <em>financial services</em> for crypto assets:
                        those tools, practices, and facilities
                        (primarily custody)
                        needed by institutional investors
                        and high-net-worth individuals.
                        Finance might not need blockchain, but the
                        blockchain economy does need new financial services.
