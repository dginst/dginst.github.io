We have analyzed the trading volumes reported by
[_The Rock Trading_](http://www.therocktrading.com/) exchange
and found them to be credible,
according to the criteria used by
[Bitwise Investments](https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/) in their
[March 2019 report](http://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2019-01/srnysearca201901-5164833-183434.pdf) to SEC.

Bitwise investigated the real liquidity of the Bitcoin market,
covering the 81 “top” Bitcoin exchanges by reported volume.
Most of those volumes turned out to be fake
and/or non-economic wash trading.
