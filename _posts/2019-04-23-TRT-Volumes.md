We have analyzed the trading volumes reported by [_The Rock Trading_](http://www.therocktrading.com/) exchange and found them to be credible, according to the criteria used by [Bitwise Investments](https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/) in their [March 2019 report](http://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2019-01/srnysearca201901-5164833-183434.pdf) to SEC.

Bitwise investigated the real liquidity of the Bitcoin market,
covering the 81 “top” Bitcoin exchanges by reported volume.
Most of those volumes turned out to be fake
and/or non-economic wash trading.

For more details about our supplemental analysis see the
[report]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/2019-04-23-trt-volumes.pdf).
