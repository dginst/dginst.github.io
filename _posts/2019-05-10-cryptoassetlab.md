We are happy to announce [Crypto Asset Lab](http://cryptoassetlab.diseade.unimib.it/), a research initiative on crypto-assets (Bitcoin *in primis*) as investment opportunity, fintech innovation, and regulatory challenge.

Milano-Bicocca has been offering a
“[Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology](https://www.ametrano.net/bbt/)” course,
taught by [Ferdinando M. Ametrano]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/#team),
since [2015/2016](https://www.ametrano.net/courses/#past-university-courses);
going forward in that direction,
the new lab is a joint effort of the University and
our Institute; its aim is to be a meeting point between academia,
industry, institutions, and regulators.

Students, researchers, and practitioners are encouraged
to join the lab and help with research, development, training,
teaching, and other experimental activities.

With a great
[faculty](https://cryptoassetlab.diseade.unimib.it/faculty/)
and an outstanding
[advisory board](http://cryptoassetlab.diseade.unimib.it/advisory-board/),
the lab promises
to be a catalyst in the Italian crypto-ecosystem for improved understanding
and informed adoption of digital assets like Bitcoin.

Crypto Asset Lab will be lunched with an
[open workshop](https://cryptoassetlab.diseade.unimib.it/2019/05/10/presentation.html)
in the afternoon of June 5, 2019
