Takeaway: In May, we noted that BTC Dominance declines have been historically associated with frenzied and stretched crypto markets. Having said that, despite the aggressiveness of the selling in the last several days, valuations that were worrying in May remain seemingly unsustainable. For example, despite being down 77% from all-time highs, DOGE’s USD 28B market cap is still, for example, roughly equivalent to that of Deutsche Bank. The SHIB token, designed to mimic DOGE and largely unheard of a month ago, has a current valuation of USD 2.6B. By comparison, Paxos, which offers crypto services to PayPal, was valued at USD 2.4B in April. XRP, trading above prices when the SEC revealed charges against its issuer Ripple in December 2020, has a market cap of USD 29B. This valuation is equal to that of Sun Life Financial, founded in 1865, which reported income of CAD 937M in Q1 of 2021. BTC, on the other hand, described as ‘digital gold’ by some of its proponents, is about 5% of gold’s total estimated valuation. In spite of the recent rise in Dominance, alt-coin valuations relative to traditional financial assets remain challenging to justify.
