                As the labour and capital markets 
                (industrial, financial and venture capital industries) 
                show strong and increasing demand for qualified technicians 
                in the field of <b>bitcoin</b> and <b>blockchain</b>,
                Digital Gold Institute is creating a <b>centre of excellence</b>
                which is recognised internationally as the incubator hub 
                for technicians and innovators.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The institute’s core activities focus on research, development, 
                training  and corporate relations with attention to the 
                <b><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/#partners">partners</a></b> of the institute 
                and in synergy with the part of the academic world which is showing attention 
                and interest to the phenomenon of bitcoin e blockchain (for example, 
                <a href="https://cryptoassetlab.diseade.unimib.it/">Milano-Bicocca</a>,
                Politecnico di Milano, ESSEC, etc.).
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The collaboration with 
                <b>researchers and students</b> in thesis projects and internship gives the 
                institute the privilege of preparing a dozen qualified professionals per year, 
                generating a network of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/full-team"><em>alumni</em></a> 
                which creates an ecosystem of proficiency and innovation. 
                The experience at the Digital Gold Institute is called a “spin cycle”: 
                the place where one step by in order to reach other shores, perhaps international.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The institute is sustained by <b>partnership</b>with 
                <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/#partners">strategic corporations</a> 
                and by client collaborations (list available upon request).
