                DGI offers training and education on
                Bitcoin, blockchain, distributed ledger,
                smart contracts, and cryptography;
                these topics are framed as
                <em>fintech innovation</em>
                in the payment/value-transmission systems
                and as cultural meeting between
                the <em>cypherpunk</em> movement and
                the Austrian school of economics.

                A solid broad introduction comes first, accessible to people
                with any background, skill level, or learning ambition,
                gradually stepping up to more advanced tech/dev topics
                that require an increasingly good attitude for
                logical, mathematical, and computational thinking.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The training material includes slides,
                reference books, open-source code and software,
                and additional links and resources for deep-diving.
                This material remains always available, including
                its future updates and evolutions.

                Please find below a description of topics,
                prerequisites and intended audience,
                organized in training modules that can be enjoyed
                in full (3 hours) or short (2 hours) sessions;
                some modules include an optional lab session
                requiring an additional hour for hands-on activity
                with laptop and internet connection.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted">
                Modules <b>1, 7, 8</b> can be enjoyed by everybody:
                c-level executives, managers, developers, researchers,
                and tech enthusiasts.
                <br>
                Module <b>2</b> starts a deeper analysis at
                functional and technical level:
                always appreciated for its crucial insights about
                the real nature of blockchain and distributed consensus,
                it possibly loses some appeal for those only interested
                in a high-level overview.
                <br>
                Modules <b>3 and 4</b> on elliptic curves,
                digital signature, and advanced cryptography
                are heavy on mathematics and intended for an audience of
                computer scientists, engineers, and
                people with good logical and
                computational skills.
                <br>
                Modules <b>5 and 6</b> are quite technical,
                mostly for developers and
                for people that interact with developers
                or are interested in gaining a good understanding
                of the technologic aspects.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                A training day for an assorted audience could
                include module 1 plus a choice of 2, 7 or 8;
                a two days' workshop could focus on functional understanding
                (modules 1, 2, 7, 8) o tech topics (modules 1, 2, 3, 5, 6).
                All modules can be experienced in 4 days,
                in a full-time intensive residency or
                over a longer period as a sequence of workshops;
                in the latter case, eight weekly half-day sessions
                are probably the optimal pace for comfortable learning.
